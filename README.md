# pymaceuticals-matplotlib-challenge
MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 5 Challenge

Code file name: pymaceuticals.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook performs the following function:

Read in two CSV files located in a particular directory and perform a series of basic DataFrame manipulations and statistical tests as "requested". The code then prints the output of our tests directly to the notebook cells. Specifically, the script will determine things such as: summary statistics, one correlation, one linear regression, a bar chart of number of datapoints, an outlier search and identification based on a calculated IQR, etc. 

*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

I did use a natural language description of the desired code's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help with code syntax. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this paricular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.

 ----------------------

 The repository also contains the CSV files holding the raw data in a subdirectory called 'data' located in the repository.
